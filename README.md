## FAQ

#### Is this a good beginner app to create?

Yes, I would highly recommend building an app like this to learn fundamentals of a new technology like Flutter/Dart. The video provided in [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgments) was very helpful to learning the basics. Although, you do need an understanding of core coding principles to learn Dart/Flutter.

#### How long did it take to build?

I would set aside a good couple hours; however, it depends on your skill level. It could take a beginner with absolutely no coding knowledge a week, but could take a seasoned developer less than an hour.
